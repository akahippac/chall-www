# www exploit

This is the exploit for the challenge. `requirements.txt` has the Python library necessary (`Pillow` and `pwntools`).

`exploit.py` is the main exploit, send it IP address and port:

```
python2 exploit.py localhost:31337
```

As this exploit leaks the flag via a screenshot, it does a simple check to verify that the flag is there and then output the correct flag.

If you want to manually verify the exploit, in `exploit.py` change `DEBUG = False` to `DEBUG = True`, and each screenshot that the challenge sends will be displayed on your computer.

# www client

`client.py` is a simple front-end for the service, and it shows all the screenshots as they are sent.
